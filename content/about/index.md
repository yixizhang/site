# About Me

I grew up in Wuhan, a top tier city in China with 12 million population.  You may have not heard about it but it's quite like Chicago.

After graduated from Northwestern in 2013 I've worked more than 4 years as a software engineer.  Before I was fighting for deployment and product stability at Facebook and MemSQL. Now I'm at a stealth startup hacking on Time -- we're about to launch, so stay tuned!

Along the way I've touched many different sides of software, from Compiler to ORM then to React.  Yet I'm still looking for my ideal language and gear set.

During the day I read a ton from Twitter, Hacker News, and all sorts of blogs and books people recommend online.  After work, I prefer to spend time with my beautiful life partner, and my cute Akita puppy.  Before I go to sleep I usually pick up some book on my nightstand, it can be biography, history or experience about software.

I believe in fate, though it's not clear yet what my life is about.
