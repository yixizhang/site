# About Me

I grew up in China and moved to U.S. since 2008.  After a few years in grad schools, I joined the tech scene around 2012, and have been working at tech companies at different sizes.  

I call myself a backend engineer.  My interests are databases, distributed systems and programming languages.  Outside of tech, I enjoy most of my time petting my dog, and family life with my wife.
